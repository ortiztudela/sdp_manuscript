Well done! Now we are ready to start. \n\n\n\n  <Press the space bar to continue>
Today you will see a few comic strips depicting people interchanging one object. \n\n Every comic strip will start with one character waiting and soon you will see a second character entering the scene. This second character will attempt to give an object to the first character. \n\n\n\n  <Press the space bar to continue>
You will soon notice that the second character will not always succeed: sometimes the strip will finish before the object reaches the first character or something else will happen that prevents the exchange. Your task is to tell us whether the object reached its intended person or not. \n\n In order to respond you will need to use the "left" and "right" arrow keys on your keyboard. You will have reminders at the bottom of the screen showing you which key corresponds to "yes" and to "no".\n\n\n\n  <Press the space bar to continue>

We will start with a few test comics so you can get familarized with the task. \n\n\n\n  <Press the space bar to continue>
