Welcome to the second part of this study. \n\n\n\n<Press the space bar to continue>
Now we will ask you some questions about the comics that you have seen in the previous part. \n\n Some of these questions will ask you to enter some answers with your keyboard. Please try to be concise and only use one or two words maximum. \n\n You will have no time limit to respond so there is no need for you to rush; however we also ask you to not overthink responses and when you do not have a clear response just guess with whichever response seems more appropiate. \n\n\n\n<Press the space bar to continue>
You will notice that we will ask you about details of the story even if you tell us that you did not remember it. We are including those questions because we want you to try to guess what the correct response might be under those circumstances. Sometimes even very weak memory traces can help us. \n\n\n\n<Press the space bar to continue>
